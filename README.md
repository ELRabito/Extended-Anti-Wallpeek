# Extended-Anti-Wallpeek

Extended Anti Wallpeek script that also triggers outside of territories.
If you try to glitch through objects with the camera it will fade the screen to black and forces first person for 60 seconds (Can be turned off and time can be changed).
It will cover most of the buildings but sadly not objects like map fences since they have no "object type", but better than nothing.

# Territory Only Version
This will trigger only while inside a territory (For base owners and outsiders).

# Installation
1. Copy the Exile_Client_EAWP_thread.sqf to your missionfile and add the code from the initplayerlocal.sqf
